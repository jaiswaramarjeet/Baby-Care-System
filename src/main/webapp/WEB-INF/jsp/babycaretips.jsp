    <h1>Baby Care Tips</h1>
    <p>These tips can help even the most nervous first-time parents feel confident about
               caring for a newborn in no time.</p>
               <h3 id="kha_11">Getting Help After the Birth</h3>
               <p>Consider getting help during this time, which can be very hectic and overwhelming.
               While in the hospital, talk to the experts around you. Many hospitals have feeding
               specialists or lactation consultants who can help you get started <a href="/en/parents/feednewborn.html">nursing
               or bottle-feeding</a>. Nurses also are a great resource to show you how to hold, burp,
               change, and care for your baby.</p>
               <p>For in-home help, you might want to hire a baby nurse, postpartum doula, or a responsible
               neighborhood teen to help you for a short time after the birth. Your doctor or the
               hospital can help you find information about in-home help, and might make a referral
               to home health agencies.</p>
               <p>Relatives and friends often want to help too. Even if you disagree on certain things,
               don't dismiss their experience. But if you don't feel up to having guests or you have
               other concerns, don't feel guilty about placing restrictions on visitors.</p>
               <h3 id="kha_12">Handling a Newborn</h3>
               <p>If you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, their fragility may be intimidating.
               Here are a few basics to remember:</p>
               <ul class="kh_longline_list">
               <li><a href="/en/parents/hand-washing.html"><strong>Wash your hands</strong></a> <strong>(or
               use a hand sanitizer) before handling your baby.</strong> Newborns don't have&nbsp;a
               strong <a href="/en/parents/immune.html">immune system</a> yet, so they're at risk
               for infection. Make sure that everyone who handles your baby has clean hands.</li>
               <li><strong>Support your baby's head and neck.</strong> Cradle the head when carrying
               your baby and support the head when carrying the baby upright or when you lay your
               baby&nbsp;down.</li>
               <li><strong>Never shake your newborn, whether in play or in frustration.</strong>
               <a href="/en/parents/shaken.html">Shaking</a> can cause bleeding in the brain and
               even death. If you need to wake your infant, don't do it by shaking &mdash; instead,
               tickle your baby's feet or blow gently on a cheek.</li>
               <li><strong>Make sure your baby is securely fastened into the <a href="/en/parents/products-seats.html">carrier,
               stroller, or car seat</a>.</strong> Limit any activity that could be too rough or
               bouncy.</li>
               <li><strong>Remember that your newborn is not ready for rough play</strong>, such
               as being jiggled on the knee or thrown in the air.</li>
               </ul>
               <h3 id="kha_13">Bonding and Soothing</h3>
               <p><a href="/en/parents/bonding.html">Bonding</a>, probably one of the most pleasurable
               parts of infant care, happens during the sensitive time in the first hours and days
               after birth when parents make a deep connection with their infant. Physical closeness
               can promote an emotional connection.</p>
               <p>For infants, the attachment contributes to their emotional growth, which also affects
               their development in other areas, such as physical growth. Another way to think of
               bonding is "falling in love" with your baby. Children thrive from having a parent
               or other adult in their life who loves them unconditionally.</p>
               <p>Begin bonding by cradling your baby and gently stroking him or her in different
               patterns. Both you and your partner can also take the opportunity to be "skin-to-skin,"
               holding your newborn against your own skin while feeding or cradling.</p>
               <p>Babies, especially <a href="/en/parents/preemies.html">premature babies</a> and
               those with <a class="kh_anchor">medical problems</a>, may respond to <strong>infant
               massage</strong>. Certain types of massage may enhance bonding and help with infant
               growth and development. Many books and videos cover infant massage &mdash; ask your
               doctor for recommendations. Be careful, however &mdash; babies are not as strong as
               adults, so massage your baby gently.</p>
               <p>Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking, babbling, singing, and cooing.
               Your baby will probably also love listening to music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles
               are other good ways to stimulate your infant's hearing. If your little one is being
               fussy, try singing, reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or <a href="/en/parents/reading-babies.html">reading</a>
               aloud as you sway or rock your baby gently in a chair.</p>
               <p>Some babies can be unusually sensitive to touch, light, or sound, and might startle
               and cry easily, sleep less than expected, or turn their faces away when someone speaks
               or sings to them. If that's the case with your baby, keep noise and light levels low
               to moderate.</p>
               <p><strong>Swaddling</strong>, which works well for some babies during their first
               few weeks, is another soothing technique first-time parents should learn. Proper swaddling
               keeps a baby's arms close to the body while allowing for some movement of the legs.
               Not only does swaddling keep a baby warm, but it seems to give most newborns a sense
               of security and comfort. Swaddling also may help limit the startle reflex, which can
               wake a baby.</p>
               <p>Here's how to swaddle a baby:</p>
               <ul class="kh_longline_list">
               <li>Spread out the receiving blanket, with one corner folded over slightly.</li>
               <li>Lay the baby face-up on the blanket with his or her head above the folded corner.</li>
               <li>Wrap the left corner over the body and tuck it beneath the back of the baby, going
               under the right arm.</li>
               <li>Bring the bottom corner up over the baby's feet and pull it toward the head, folding
               the fabric down if it gets close to the face. Be sure not to wrap too tightly around
               the hips. Hips and knees should be slightly bent and turned out. Wrapping your baby
               too tightly may increase the chance of <a href="/en/parents/ddh.html">hip dysplasia</a>.</li>
               <li>Wrap the right corner around the baby, and tuck it under the baby's back on the
               left side, leaving only the neck and head exposed. To make sure your baby is not wrapped
               too tight, make sure you can slip a hand between the blanket and your baby's chest,
               which will allow comfortable breathing. Make sure, however, that the blanket is not
               so loose that it could become undone.</li>
               <li>Babies should not be swaddled after they're 2 months old. At this age, some babies
               can roll over while swaddled, which increases their risk of sudden infant death syndrome
               (SIDS).</li>
               </ul><h3 id="kha_21">All About Diapering</h3>
               <p>You'll probably decide before you bring your baby home whether you'll use cloth
               or disposable diapers. Whichever you use, your little one will dirty diapers about
               10 times a day, or about 70 times a week.</p>
               <p>Before <a href="/en/parents/diapering.html">diapering your baby</a>, make sure
               you have all supplies within reach so you won't have to leave your infant unattended
               on the changing table. You'll need:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>a clean diaper</li>
               <li>fasteners (if cloth prefold diapers are used)</li>
               <li>diaper ointment</li>
               <li>diaper wipes (or a container of warm water and a clean washcloth or cotton balls)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>After each bowel movement or if the diaper is wet, lay your baby on his or her
               back and remove the dirty diaper. Use the water, cotton balls, and washcloth or the
               wipes to gently wipe your baby's genital area clean. When removing a boy's diaper,
               do so carefully because exposure to the air may make him urinate. When wiping a girl,
               wipe her bottom from front to back to avoid a <a href="/en/parents/urinary.html">urinary
               tract infection (UTI)</a>. To prevent or heal a rash, apply ointment. Always remember
               to wash your hands thoroughly after changing a diaper.</p>
               <p><a href="/en/parents/diaper-rash.html">Diaper rash</a> is a common concern. Typically
               the rash is red and bumpy and will go away in a few days with warm baths, some diaper
               cream, and a little time out of the diaper. Most rashes happen because the baby's
               skin is sensitive and becomes irritated by the wet or poopy diaper.</p>
               <p>To prevent or heal diaper rash, try these tips:</p>
               <ul class="kh_longline_list">
               <li>Change your baby's diaper often, and as soon as possible after bowel movements.</li>
               <li>Gently clean the area with mild soap and water (wipes sometimes can be irritating),
               then apply a very thick layer of diaper rash or "barrier" cream. Creams with zinc
               oxide are preferred because they form a barrier against moisture.</li>
               <li>If you use cloth diapers, wash them in dye- and fragrance-free detergents.</li>
               <li>Let the baby go undiapered for part of the day. This gives the skin a chance to
               air out.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be getting worse,
               call your doctor &mdash; it may be caused by a fungal infection that requires a prescription.</p>
               <h3 id="kha_22">Bathing Basics</h3>
               <p>You should give your baby a sponge bath until:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>the umbilical cord falls off and the navel heals completely (1&ndash;4 weeks)</li>
               <li>the circumcision heals (1&ndash;2 weeks)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>A bath two or three times a week in the first year is fine. More frequent bathing
               may be drying to the skin.</p>
               <p>Have these items ready before bathing your baby:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>a soft, clean washcloth</li>
               <li>mild, unscented baby soap and shampoo</li>
               <li>a soft brush to stimulate the baby's scalp</li>
               <li>towels or blankets</li>
               <li>a clean diaper</li>
               <li>clean clothes</li>
               </ul>
               <p><strong>Sponge baths.</strong> For a sponge bath, select a safe,&nbsp;flat surface
               (such as a changing table, floor, or counter) in a warm room. Fill a sink, if nearby,&nbsp;or
               bowl with warm (not hot!) water. Undress your baby and wrap him or her in a towel.
               Wipe your infant's eyes with a washcloth (or a clean cotton ball) dampened with water
               only, starting with one eye and wiping from the inner corner to the outer corner.
               Use a clean corner of the washcloth or another cotton ball to wash the other eye.
               Clean your baby's nose and ears with the damp washcloth. Then wet the cloth again
               and, using a little soap, wash his or her face gently and pat it dry.</p>
               <p>Next, using baby shampoo, create a lather and gently wash your baby's head and
               rinse. Using a wet cloth and soap, gently wash the rest of the baby, paying special
               attention to creases under the arms, behind the ears, around the neck, and in the
               genital area. Once you have washed those areas, make sure they are dry and then diaper
               and dress your baby.</p>
               <p><strong>Tub baths.</strong> When your baby is ready for tub baths, the first baths
               should be gentle and brief. If he or she becomes upset, go back to sponge baths for
               a week or two, then try the bath again.</p>
               <p>In addition to the supplies listed above, add:</p>
               <ul>
               <li>an infant tub with 2 to 3 inches of warm &mdash; not hot! &mdash; water (to test
               the water temperature, feel the water with the inside of your elbow or wrist). An
               infant tub is a plastic tub that can fit in the bathtub; it's a better size for babies
               and makes bathing easier to manage.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Undress your baby and then place him or her in the water immediately, in a warm
               room, to prevent chills. Make sure the water in the tub is no more than 2 to 3 inches
               deep, and that the water is no longer running in the tub. Use one of your hands to
               support the head and the other hand to guide the baby in feet-first. Speaking gently,
               slowly lower your baby up to the chest into the tub.</p>
               <p>Use a washcloth to wash his or her face and hair. Gently massage your baby's scalp
               with the pads of your fingers or a soft baby hairbrush, including the area over the
               fontanelles (soft spots) on the top of the head. When you rinse the soap or shampoo
               from your baby's head, cup your hand across the forehead so the suds run toward the
               sides and soap doesn't get into the eyes. Gently wash the rest of your baby's body
               with water and a small amount of soap.</p>
               <p>Throughout the bath, regularly pour water gently over your baby's body so he or
               she doesn't get cold. After the bath, wrap your baby in a towel immediately, making
               sure to cover his or her head. Baby towels with hoods are great for keeping a freshly
               washed baby warm.</p>
               <p>While bathing your infant, <strong>never</strong> leave the baby alone. If you
               need to leave the bathroom, wrap the baby in a towel and take him or her with you.</p><h3 id="kha_31">Circumcision and Umbilical Cord Care</h3>
               <p>Immediately after <a href="/en/parents/circumcision.html">circumcision</a>, the
               tip of the penis is usually covered with gauze coated with petroleum jelly to keep
               the wound from sticking to the diaper. Gently wipe the tip clean with warm water after
               a diaper change, then apply petroleum jelly to the tip so it doesn't stick to the
               diaper. Redness or irritation of the penis should heal within a few days, but if the
               redness or swelling increases or if pus-filled blisters form, infection may be present
               and you should call your baby's doctor immediately.</p>
               <p>Umbilical cord care in newborns is also important. Some doctors suggest swabbing
               the area with rubbing alcohol until the cord stump dries up and falls off, usually
               in 10 days to 3 weeks, but others recommend leaving the area alone. Talk to your child's
               doctor to see what he or she prefers.</p>
               <p>An infant's navel area shouldn't be submerged in water until the cord stump falls
               off and the area is healed. Until it falls off, the cord stump will change color from
               yellow to brown or black &mdash; this is normal. Call your doctor if the navel area
               looks red or if a foul odor or discharge develops.</p>
               <h3 id="kha_32">Feeding and Burping Your Baby</h3>
               <p>Whether feeding your newborn by <a href="/en/parents/breast-bottle-feeding.html">breast
               or a bottle</a>, you may be stumped as to how often to do so. Generally, it's recommended
               that babies be fed <strong>on demand</strong> &mdash; whenever they seem hungry. Your
               baby may cue you by crying, putting fingers in his or her mouth, or making sucking
               noises.</p>
               <p>A newborn baby needs to be fed every 2 to 3 hours. If you're breastfeeding, give
               your baby the chance to nurse about 10&ndash;15 minutes at each breast. If you're
               formula-feeding, your baby will most likely take about 2&ndash;3 ounces (60&ndash;90
               milliliters) at each feeding.</p>
               <p>Some newborns may need to be awakened every few hours to make sure they get enough
               to eat. Call your baby's doctor if you need to wake your newborn often or if your
               baby doesn't seem interested in eating or sucking.</p>
               <p>If you're formula-feeding, you can easily monitor if your baby is getting enough
               to eat, but if you're breastfeeding, it can be a little trickier. If your baby seems
               satisfied, produces about six wet diapers and several stools a day, sleeps well, and
               is gaining weight regularly, then he or she is probably eating enough.</p>
               <p>Another good way to tell if your baby is getting milk is to notice if your breasts
               feel full before feeding your baby and less full after feeding. Talk to your doctor
               if you have concerns about your child's <a href="/en/parents/grownewborn.html">growth</a>
               or feeding schedule.</p>
               <p>Babies often swallow air during feedings, which can make them fussy. To help prevent
               this, burp your baby often. Try burping your baby every 2&ndash;3 ounces (60&ndash;90
               milliliters) if you bottle-feed, and each time you switch breasts if you breastfeed.</p>
               <p>If your baby tends to be gassy, has <a href="/en/parents/gerd-reflux.html">gastroesophageal
               reflux</a>, or seems fussy during feeding, try burping your little one after every
               ounce during bottle-feeding or every 5 minutes during breastfeeding.</p>
               <p>Try these&nbsp;burping tips:</p>
               <ul class="kh_longline_list">
               <li>Hold your baby upright with his or her head on your shoulder. Support your baby's
               head and back while gently patting the back with your other hand.</li>
               <li>Sit your baby on your lap. Support your baby's chest and head with one hand by
               cradling your baby's chin in the palm of your hand and resting the heel of your hand
               on your baby's chest (be careful to grip your baby's chin &mdash; not throat). Use
               the other hand to gently pat your baby's back.</li>
               <li>Lay your baby face-down on your lap. Support your baby's head, making sure it's
               higher than his or her chest, and gently pat or rub his or her back.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If your baby doesn't burp after a few minutes, change the baby's position and try
               burping for another few minutes before feeding again. Always burp your baby when feeding
               time is over, then keep him or her in an upright position for at least 10&ndash;15
               minutes to avoid spitting up.</p><h3 id="kha_41">Sleeping Basics</h3>
               <p>As a new parent, you may be surprised to learn that your newborn, who seems to
               need you every minute of the day, actually <a href="/en/parents/sleepnewborn.html">sleeps</a>
               about 16 hours or more!</p>
               <p>Newborns typically sleep for periods of 2&ndash;4 hours. Don't expect yours to
               sleep through the night &mdash; the digestive system of babies is so small that they
               need nourishment every few hours and should be awakened if they haven't been fed for
               4 hours (or more often if your doctor is concerned about weight gain).</p>
               <p>When can you expect your baby to sleep through the night? Many babies sleep through
               the night (between 6&ndash;8 hours) at 3 months of age, but if yours doesn't, it's
               not a cause for concern. Like adults, babies must develop their own sleep patterns
               and cycles, so if your newborn is gaining weight and appears healthy, don't despair
               if he or she hasn't slept through the night at 3 months.</p>
               <p>It's important to <strong>always</strong> place babies on their backs to sleep
               to reduce the risk of <a href="/en/parents/sids.html">SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)</a>.
               Other safe sleeping practices include: not using blankets, quilts, sheepskins, stuffed
               animals, and pillows in the crib or bassinet (these can suffocate a baby); and sharing
               a bedroom (but <strong>not</strong> a <a href="/en/parents/cosleeping.html">bed</a>)
               with the parents for the first 6 months to 1 year. Also be sure to alternate the position
               of your baby's head from night to night (first right, then left, and so on) to prevent
               the development of a <a href="/en/parents/positional-plagiocephaly.html">flat spot</a>
               on one side of the head.</p>
               <p>Many newborns have their days and nights "mixed up." They tend to be more awake
               and alert at night, and more sleepy during the day. One way to help them is to keep
               stimulation at night to a minimum. Keep the lights low, such as by using a nightlight.
               Reserve talking and playing with your baby for the daytime. When your baby wakes up
               during the day, try to keep him or her awake a little longer by talking and playing.</p>
               <p>Even though you may feel anxious about handling a newborn, in a few short weeks
               you'll develop a routine and be parenting like a pro! If you have questions or concerns,
               ask your doctor to recommend resources that can help you and your baby grow together.</p>
